    <h2>ShopGreen</h2>
    <center>
      <p>A Google Chrome extension paired with a website that allows users to 
        track their shopping habits and find more sustainable options for their 
        closet by generating a sustainability score for online products and 
        reporting their environmental impact to users.</p>
    </center>



    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Background</h2>
    <p> This project was developed in February of 2022 during the UT Austin Women 
      in Computer Science Hackathon alongside two other developers, with a timeline of 24 hours. </p>
    <p> The categories that our project aimed to target were “environmentalism” 
      and “data visualization”. When pairing these two categories together, 
      my partners and I hoped to illustrate the impact of harmful habits 
      that many people are engaged in but may not be aware of. Our goal 
      was to help cultivate meaningful impact and motivation to improve 
      current conditions through changes that are easy to implement and 
      understand. This led us to create an application that targets the 
      fast fashion industry, due to its prevalence among our population. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">My Role</h2>
    <p> I was the Lead UX Designer in this project; I generated the wireframe 
      for the website version of our application and assisted with the wireframe 
      for the Google Chrome extension of our application. I worked with my 
      partners to create iterations of the wireframe while conducting research 
      and studying strategies for our application to become effective. Through 
      consistent collaboration with my partners, we identified the key features 
      that should be included in our application. Finally, our group jointly created 
      a slide deck to present our application in front of the judges in the hackathon. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Problem</h2>
    <p> 
      A rising issue in our society is “fast fashion”, which is 
      described as purchasing low-priced but stylish clothing to 
      meet current trends. This harms the environment, as the pollution, 
      waste, and emissions from fast fashion byproducts like plastic 
      fibers fuel the triple planetary crisis. 
      (https://unep.org/news-and-stories/story/environmental-costs-fast-fashion) 
      At the same time, “the fashion industry consumes one-tenth of all of the 
      water used industrially to run factories and clean products. 
      Approximately 20% of the wastewater worldwide is attributed to 
      this process, which accumulates over time. As many factories 
      moved overseas as stated previously, they may be in countries 
      without strict environmental regulations, resulting in untreated 
      water to enter the oceans. Regrettably, the wastewater created is 
      extremely toxic and in many cases, cannot be treated to become safe 
      again… Additionally, due to the number of cut outs for the clothing, 
      a large amount of materials are being wasted as they cannot be used 
      any further for one certain type of production. 57% of all discarded 
      clothing ends up in landfill; the landfills start to pile up, then 
      the trash is moved to an area to be incinerated” 
      (https://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/7/20/the-impact-of-fast-fashion-on-the-environment). 
      It is estimated by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation that a truckload of 
      abandoned textiles is dumped in landfill or incinerated every second.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Solution</h2>
    <p> To increase awareness of the previously mentioned harmful 
      processes and consequences involved in fast fashion, our 
      group created a product that supports the habits of shopping 
      more sustainably and keeps people accountable for their actions. 
      While we track people’s shopping habits, we generate a 
      sustainability score that encapsulates the environmental impact 
      of items that they peruse or add to their shopping carts. The 
      sustainability score takes into account the amount of pollution, 
      waste, and emissions involved in producing those items. This 
      ultimately guides users to find more sustainable options by 
      providing an easy method for tracking the degree of harm associated 
      with purchasing such items. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Project Summary</h2>
    <p> Our product consists of a Google Chrome extension that allows users to 
      track their shopping habits to find more sustainable options by generating 
      a sustainability scores that reports the environmental impact of items to 
      users. This extension also allows users to keep track of their budget when 
      shopping so that they can remain conscious of their spending habits in 
      addition to their impact on the environment. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Another feature of this extension includes a section dedicated to describing 
      the materials that an item is composed of, breaking down the reasoning 
      behind a given sustainability score. After reading through this 
      information, users can choose to add this item to their cart and/or 
      forward this information to their friends to help more people become 
      aware of their environmental impact from shopping certain products.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      This extension is designed to be accessible on every platform that users 
      visit when shopping online, with the goal of guiding users to create a 
      knowledgeable decision on what they can add to their wardrobe while 
      respecting the environment that sustains us.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      From this Google Chrome extension, users can be redirected to our 
      application’s website, which further builds upon the information 
      presented in the extension through the inclusion of visual diagrams 
      that illustrate the composition of items in people’s shopping carts. 
      A tracker page breaks down the composition of items in a user’s 
      shopping cart by their material and includes several graphs to 
      reveal the ratios.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Finally, users can sign in to their accounts to access more features 
      like connecting with friends and sharing their shopping cart details 
      with one another. This interactive experience continues to cultivate 
      accountability, as their environmental impacts become more public, 
      and it cultivates community, as users promote habits that protect 
      the Earth together.

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">What I Learned</h2>
    <p> An important skill I learned from this project was how to make the 
      prototype more interactive, especially since we had designed multiple 
      drop-down features in the website version. For example, I started with 
      the simple idea of creating two identical pages on our Figma wireframe 
      and overlaying a drop-down box in one of the pages to imitate the 
      effect of a drop-down box suddenly appearing on the screen after 
      adding a connection from the first page (without the drop-down) to 
      the second page (with the drop-down). After our team completed the 
      basic outlines of our entire design, I was able to find a better way 
      to implement this drop-down feature by exploring through Figma and 
      searching through the internet. I eventually implemented a popup overlay 
      modal that made the work much more clean and efficient. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Another important skill I learned was how to work in iterations. 
      As a recovering perfectionist, I had to learn that the initial planning 
      phases are never flawless and that there is always room for improvement. 
      As a result, this project allowed me the opportunity to create several 
      versions of wireframes and varying levels of wireframes to improve upon 
      our working features and create a final product that could be easily 
      understood. This was very encouraging, as our group was able to evolve 
      and grow throughout the entire process. </p>
