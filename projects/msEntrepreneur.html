    <h2>Ms. Entrepreneur</h2>
    <center>
      <p>A social media platform that allows users to connect with and empower one another, find upcoming and nearby events, explore different businesses that they can support, and develop a better sense on how to manage their own companies.</p>
    </center>

    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Background</h2>
    <p> This project was developed in June of 2021 during the virtual Girls Who Code Work Prep program (in 
      collaboration with JPMorgan Chase) with two other UX designers, with a timeline of 2 hours. </p>
    <p> Participants were separated into groups that focused on different challenges, and our 
      group was assigned to target the following issue: "Female business owners 
      often work 3X harder to build relationships and seek investment funding as compared to their 
      male counterparts. How can we use technology to to help women get access to these networks 
      and build relationships / share tools that will help them be successful in securing funding?". Throughout 
      this buildathon, we implemented our newly learned skills around Agile Methodology and UX Design to 
      to create a technical solution for this social good challenge around a female driven issue.  </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">My Role</h2>
    <p> I was n UX Designer in the project cycle, and I led my group by planning the wireframe and coordinating 
      brainstorming sessions amongst two other designers in my group. I facilitated conversations to 
      ensure that our product would stand out while remaining inclusive, and I created a slide deck
      to present our product in front of judges and our peers in the program. </p>
    <br><br>

    <!-- <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Challenges</h2>
    <p> </p>
    <br><br> -->

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Project Summary</h2>
    <p>To start, we spent time in brainstorming sessions 
      discussing possible solutions to this problem. The main issue was the lack of 
      access to existing networks for women to build relationships from, so we considered 
      our personal experiences from building virtual relationships. This led us to reference 
      platforms like LinkedIn and Handshake, which often help users connected with one another 
      and also provided us with a foundation for what we wanted our product to look like.
      However, we wanted an even more advanced version of these applications with features
      that allowed specifically women and non-binary individuals (who are also 
      underrepresented) to feel more comfortable sharing their stories with one another. As a result,
      we designed a social media platform that primarily supports the interactions between women
      and non-binary individuals with the following features: 
      allows users to connect with and empower 
      one another, find upcoming and nearby events, explore different businesses that they 
      can support, and develop a better sense on how to manage their own companies. This 
      includes the following features:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="font-size: 16px; transform: translate(2.5%); line-height:28px;">
      <li>A home page that displays upcoming events for users to connect with one another at 
        and posts that users can interact with one another through.
      </li>
      <li>A calendar that also functions as a schedule so that users can easily identify 
        upcoming events. There is an attached notes section at the bottom of the calendar
        for users to record reminders or any meaningful topics from events.
      </li>
      <li>An explore page for users to discover new events, people, and/or hashtags 
        that automatically provides suggestions. They can also find specific items (e.g. 
        users or topics of interest) with the search bar at the top of the page.
      </li>
      <li>A messaging page that allows users to continue conversations through our platform,
        allowing them a convenient way to ask each other questions related to their businesses.
      </li>
      <li>A profile page that provides more insight on who business owners are and shares the
        experiences that inspired owners to start their business. This helps users learn about
        the human behind a business, nurturing greater and stronger connections.
      </li>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      To be even more inclusive, we wanted to make sure that everyone who wanted to 
      support these underrepresented groups could participate if interested. In this 
      manner, our application allows men to sign up as investors for 
      the registered businesses.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      All in all, we hoped to create an application that is fun and relaxing for our users
      while they developed a brand and built a successful business. We also wanted to ensure
      that our model encouraged people to invest in the person -- not just a company. With 
      the implementation of profile pages that narrates the story of a person behind their 
      business and with the limitless opportunities for user interactions, we believe 
      that we were able to accomplish this vision.

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">What I Learned</h2>
    <p> This was my first project with Figma, so I learned a lot through this hands-on
      experience! I greatly enjoyed the design process, as well as collaborating with my peers 
      to decide on how we would develop our final product. This project also reinforced
      the importance of creating projects that can help our communities, as we were reminded
      that we can use our extensive experience with certain technologies like social media 
      for good use. Another important component that we were reminded to consider is including
      the factors that will generate the most impact for our target audience. There were already many 
      extisting iterations of the same category of product (e.g. Handshake could be characterized as an 
      alternative form of LinkedIn, since both are used for job opportunities), so we
      had to conceptualize features that set our application apart. I found this process 
      to be extremely exciting, as it allowed us to channel our creative energies, and we were able to
      consolidate all of our ideas together.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Although we were not able to fully execute our ideas due to the time constraint 
      of the buildathon, our group's skill set grew tremendously from the start of the session. We 
      learned and taught each other how to navigate through Figma, and our habit of
      collaborating with one another was a
      significant component that helped us win our challenge's category. I was very excited to 
      have created my first UX project, and I am confident in my ability to grow even more 
      from this point forward. </p>
