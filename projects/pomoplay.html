    <h2>pomoplay</h2>
    <center>
      <p> A mobile application that enables users to create better studying habits by blocking  
        distractions from their phones with a lockdown feature and rewarding good study habits with virtual coins 
        that can be used to play various games on the application. </p>
    </center>

    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Background</h2>
    <p> This project was developed in February of 2023 during the UT Austin Women in Computer Science Hackathon
      alongside one other developer, with a timeline of 10 hours. </p>
    <p> The theme of this year's hackathon was "arcade", so my partner and I wanted to incorporate 
      some form of play into our application. After spending time to ideate possible products, we 
      determined to create a fun and effective way for students to study. Thus, our application aims to 
      eliminate distractions for people while they are studying but also rewards them with breaks 
      (e.g. playing a quick game) at short intervals
      after they have completed parts of their study session. This process was inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">My Role</h2>
    <p> I was the Lead UX Designer in this project, and I created all of the wireframes for our 
      application. I also conducted research and studied strategies for our application to become 
      effective. I consistently collaborated with my partner to coordinate and discuss key 
      features that should be included in our application. Finally, I created a slide deck that we used
      to present our application in front of the judges in the hackathon. </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Problem</h2>
    <p> 
      The elements of both "play" and "study" are important in the life of college 
      students. However, it is important for people to find a balance between these two elements 
      if they want to continue their education while remaining happy and sane. 
      When researching the prevalence of scenarios where “play” and “study” 
      are out of balance, we found studies yielding the following observations: 
    </p>
    <br>
    <div style="font-size: 16px; transform:translate(2.5%); line-height:28px;">
      <li> “The ability to strike a perceived sense of balance between work 
        and life represents a challenge for many in academic and research 
        sectors around the world… Spending time on self-care and relaxation 
        is a necessity in life to maintain a healthy body and mind, leading 
        to a fulfilling lifestyle. This, in turn, will enable [people] to 
        achieve peak performance and productivity in the workspace” 
        (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282063/#pcbi.1009124.ref028). 
        In other words, people should set aside time each day for an activity 
        that they enjoy, which includes playing their favorite games for short 
        intervals of time. </li>
      <li> “Mentally demanding work causes strain reactions that increase in 
        magnitude with the duration of work… [As a result,] students might 
        require health-promoting scheduling of work and leisure to avoid 
        an accumulation of strain”, i.e. burnout 
        (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10298359/). </li>
      <li> A common reason why people tend to procrastinate is because of poor 
        time management skills or because some tasks are too overwhelming. “In a 
        2013 study, Dr. Pychyl and Dr. Sirois found that procrastination can 
        be understood as ‘the primacy of short-term mood repair… over the 
        longer-term pursuit of intended actions.’ Put simply, procrastination 
        is about being more focused on ‘the immediate urgency of managing 
        negative moods’ than getting on with the task, Dr. Sirois said. 
        The particular nature of our aversion depends on the given task 
        or situation. It may be due to something inherently unpleasant 
        about the task itself… but it might also result from deeper 
        feelings related to the task, such as self-doubt, low self-esteem, 
        anxiety or insecurity” 
        (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html).  </li>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Solution</h2>
    <p> While many people have different study techniques, we found that the 
      Pomodoro study technique was the most trending amongst the college-age 
      population. Additionally, it was effective because of its ability to 
      “alternate pomodoros — focused work sessions — with frequent short 
      breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental 
      fatigue. The 25-minute work sprints are the core of the method 
      [with 5-minute break sessions afterward]” 
      (https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). This 
      technique is effective because it breaks down complex projects 
      into manageable action items, making it less likely for people to 
      procrastinate in the attempt to temporarily engage in short-term mood
      repair. This technique simultaneously offers a balance between work and 
      life, as the break sessions offer relief from burnout. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There is also an opportunity for self-improvement during this 
      process, as the Pomodoro technique teaches more about consistency
      than perfection. Each session is a fresh start for users to 
      reevaluate their goals, challenge themselves to focus, and limit 
      distractions. This system can further be modified and adapted to 
      each individual, which is helpful in the case where the 25-minute 
      work/5-minute break does not work for someone. “In that case, they 
      can find a time frame that does work. The idea is to break bigger 
      tasks into smaller ones with uninterrupted focused work, followed 
      by breaks to relax your mind. Regular breaks are important to do 
      efficient work” (https://science.nichd.nih.gov/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=160956640). </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">Project Summary</h2>
    <p> This application enables users to create better studying habits. To 
      implement the Pomodoro technique with a gaming component, we planned 
      to create a mobile app that helps users focus on their tasks by 
      implementing a lockdown page that prevents them from getting 
      distracted by other apps on their phones. </p>
    <br>
    <p> On this lockdown page, users first input the amount of time they 
      want to study for and the number of breaks they would like to take 
      throughout their study session. Once the timer starts for their 
      study session, the app "locks" their phones such that they are 
      unable to swipe out of the application until after the entire 
      study session is completed. There is an emergency “stop” button 
      if they must leave the app for emergencies, but they must enter a 
      password and confirm their desire to stop studying to escape the 
      lockdown feature. </p>
    <br>
    <p> When it's time for a break, the app notifies users that they 
      can step away from their study materials and offers them the 
      opportunity to play a short game (approximately five minutes 
      long) hosted on our app if they are interested. This cycle 
      continues until the entire study session is over. </p>
    <br>
    <p> To incentivize users to study more often and reward them 
      for their good study habits, we also implemented a currency 
      system in the app. For every five minutes that our users study, 
      they receive a virtual coin that can be accumulated to purchase 
      games (e.g. Solitaire, Minesweeper) in the games tab of our 
      application. Users also will receive badges whenever they hit 
      certain milestones on our app (e.g. continuously utilizing the 
      app for 5 hours), which are displayed on a user's profile page.</p>

    <h2 class="portfolio-heading">What I Learned</h2>
    <p> Throughout this project, I learned more about creating organizational structures 
      in my wireframe that 
      are both aesthetically pleasing and easy to follow. For example, I spent more 
      time considering the color palette and layout of our product so that the 
      application would be calming for our users to use while they are studying. 
      I also made sure to consider the contrast of elements against each other so 
      that they are distinguishable and denote their significance (e.g. the “stop” 
      button on the lockdown page was made red since it is universally recognized 
      as the color for stopping). </p>
    <br>
    <p> Additionally, I learned about the importance of grouping elements 
      such as frames, text boxes, 
      and assets together on Figma so that they can be efficiently identified and 
      manipulated on each page. This was helpful in the long run, as it 
      saved time when a small detail had to be changed that would later affect 
      other elements. It was also helpful to understand which groups 
      belonged to which page for coding purposes, as ReactJS heavily 
      relies on components, and organizing these elements into components 
      in the wireframe conveniently reduced the amount of thinking 
      required for creating components when building the user interface. </p>
